        <h2>The learning cycle</h2>
        <p>Generally, when I learn a new code feature or language the learning cycle goes: Tutorial -> project -> more complex project.</p>
        <p>the cycle usually ends at 1 project, and it's usually not entirely finished, but my goal was to learn the new thing rather than complete the project.</p>

        <style>li{margin: 1em}</style>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a Tutorial online, hopefully a first party Tutorial, about the code language / framework / feature I want to learn.</li>
            <li>Follow the tutorial through to the end.</li>
            <li>Build a little extra past the tutorial in some way.</li>
            <li>Start a new project from scratch and start building it, using Google, ChatGPT, and documentation as a guide for how to use the features.</li>
            <li>Continue with project until I'm satisfied learning the code language / framework / feature.</li>
        </ol>
