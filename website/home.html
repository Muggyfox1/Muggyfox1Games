        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a solo dev that strives to create fun, useful, and affordable software for everyone.</p>
        <p>I believe that honesty is worth it, no matter what, that apps should be useful, games should be fun, and that not everything will appeal to everyone.</p>
        <p>I aim to create apps that are flexible and useful beyond my own lifetime.</p>
        <p>I aim to create games that inspire people and teach them the bits of wisdom I know.</p>
